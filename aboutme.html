            First things first, I know what you're thinking. "What's with the grainy space image for the background of this page?" Well it's actually a high res image from the Hubble Space Telescope. the image only appears grainy because of it's sheer size and the distance of the stars and galaxies. I chose that as the background for this page because technology, space, and really all things science are some of my greatest interests.

            When I'm not nerding out over science articles or documentaries I like to spend time working on my Jeep or renovating my house. At the time of writing this, I am nearly finished with a complete rework of my basement which you can see pictured above this paragraph. Outside of any ongoing projects I enjoy playing video games with my friends online, watching my favorite Youtubers, and spending time with my nephew.
